            <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 1 inch piece of fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>4 prepared pie crusts</li>
            <li>2 egg whites, beaten, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low
                 and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; coarsely mash.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger,
                 salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
                  Remove skillet from heat and stir tomatoes and peas into onion mixture; pour into mashed potatoes and thoroughly mix.
                   Cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 even triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling 
                creating a triangular 'hat' shape. Pinch the dough together to form a seal. Brush egg white over each samosa and arrange 
                on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
